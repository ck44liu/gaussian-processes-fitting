# gaussian-processes-fitting
This project uses Gaussian Processes to investigate the occurance of muscle co-contraction when an individual is tracing a curve. Both global window approach and sliding window approach are utilized. We use radial-basis function for the kernel. The co-contraction occurs when we observe a sudden change, namely a spike, of sigma^2 and length_scale across different local windows.
